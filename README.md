# gameSauceNHLApplication

## Description
This application is a passion project of mine, that I have used to learn React, as well as improve upon my JavaScript skills. Featuring a clean, and easy to navigate UI, this application pulls information from the NHL's public API to display game information to the user. The homepage features either the first game to be played if no game has started, the most current game to start if any of the games are in progress, or if all games have been finished, it displays the last game played that night. There is a "Games" page that features all of the days games, with scores, and the game status. These game boxes can be clicked to bring the user back to a page similar to the homepage, except displaying the game they clicked on statistics. Clicking home will bring the user back the homepage where the most current game will be displayed. 

*In Development*
App users can create accounts with an email and password, with the password being secured, and crypted by "bcrypt". This allows the user to save favorite teams and have a list of their teams upcoming games.
